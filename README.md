* How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?

    As the Scrum Master, I rely on frequent, constructive communication with the Product Owner. Considering ChadaTech now embraces Agile Development, the Product Owner is now part of the Scrum Team and is respsonsible for collecting product feedback from real-life users and other stakeholders. This feedback is valuable information the Scrum Team needs to improve the product and overall quality of the final deliverable. The Product Owner prioritizes this feedback into "user stories" that I can share with my developers and testers. As Scrum Master, I can now discuss product improvements through story points and delegate up-to-date sprints to my team.

* How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

    I approach program development thorugh managable sprints and sprint-planning. Breaking down the workload into smaller increments will decrease the chance of error while developing code, and sprints provide the tester with more time to focus on quality assurance. Sprint reviews can be conducted every 1-2 weeks, opposed to a more traditional 1-2 months.
   More importantly, I believe Daily Stand-Ups are essential to ensure quality deliverables. Daily Stand-Ups enable the Scrum Team to communicate productively and with transparancy. Every team member has the chance to explain, "What did I accomplish yesterday? What will I accomplish today? What support do I need to continue moving forward?" Additionally, I plan to utilize "information radiators" in my future work because in my opinion it is extremely effective keeping the entire team informed and working together as one unit.

* What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

    A good team member embraces transparancey and openness with their other team members; they should be able to count on one another to provide help when needed. For example, a developer should be able to trust the tester will fix their errors/mistakes and give constructive feedback so the Developer can make future improvements. On the other hand, the Tester should be able to count on the developer to help test code so the Tester can focus on QA when they are backed up with too many test cases. This example defines agile methodology.
  Being a good team member means continuous and honest communication is required, not optional. This means constructive face-to-face communiction, frequent e-mailing, updating "information radiators", utlizing tools like Microsoft Azure Boards, etc. is a continuous and open practice. Team members should be able to embrace change during sprints and re-organize their strategy as a collective.

  This repository highlights the development industry's on-going transition toward agile developmemt moving away from traditional methodology. The coursework specifically focuses on Scrum and Waterfall life-cycles as well as communication tools. However, Agile and Traditional Methods can be blended together to meet a project or Product Owner's demand. 

  Attached are assignments and journal entries based off the four main roles of Scrum: The Product Owner, The Scrum Master, Developer(s), 
and Tester(s). Agile tools and transparent, open communication aid the teams success. These files outline the advantages of agile development explaining why Scrum is the better option in most cases. However, Scrum has some disadvantags, and traditional development is still necesssry when working on large enterprise teams. A combination of both methods may be the best approach for large-scale operatons.
